Screenshot help:

To take a screenshot press F12 on your keyboard.

To change the location where your screenshots save, look under the edit tab for options.
Options include:
-Default (the SFA folder)
-Desktop
-Documents
-Pictures

It will create a folder called "SFACAST-Screenshots" there the first time that location is used.
Then it will save them in that folder as long as the name is not changed.
The program defaults to that folder that is already created, unless:
-the name is changed
-there is more than one folder with that name
